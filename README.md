# News Website: Fetch and Display Data from a Public API

## Project Description

Welcome to the News Website project! This is the task I completed as part of the first round of interviews for an internship at BrainyBeam Info-Tech Pvt Ltd.

The goal of this project was to build a news website that fetches and displays data from a public news API. 

The website features a clean, responsive design with support for both light and dark modes, based on the user's system preferences.

## Features
